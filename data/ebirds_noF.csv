Times and mileages for the two bouts in this location have been lumped (overall, 2.4 miles of driving and 0.5 mile walked).","1 heard peenting from wet meadow just west of trail to Porcupine Lake; 1 observed well and at close range (including with spotlight) displaying from side of road at the 18-mile Creek Road.

It was sunny, 72, and calm when I arrived at Yahola.  The lake was like glass.  I mainly came out to look for the rare gulls that had been reported at Lake Yahola recently and to watch the Woodcock displays at sunset.  I didn't have any luck finding the rare gulls, but the woodcock displays were the best I've ever seen.  I believe there were several more birds than five, but I saw five at the same time.  I lost count of how many displays I witnessed.  On more than one occasion there were two males courting one female.  Then there would be a skirmish and one male would chase the other back into the woods.  The males were strutting with raised wings in front of the females.  Then the pair would fly up and do an aerial display and come back down with twittering wings.  The peenting started at 7:32.  The displaying started about 7:35 and continued until 8:07.  It was an outstanding evening.  In addition to the birds, I also saw several deer, rabbits, an armadillo, a beaver, and squirrels.   <br />Submitted from BirdLog NA for iOS, version 1.8",""

The previous checklist at this site today recorded birds detected along the Bearpaw Trail southeast from and then back northwest to that point.  This checklist begins at the same point but in the other direction.  I hiked north along the trail and then Tars Pond Road, and then turned west on FR 359a for nearly a mile.  Because of time constraints, I had to stop just short of the wetland complex in the NW corner of the block just east of the private property.  The last few hundred meters of FR 359a were clogged with waist- to head-height shrub limbs.  Turned around right where trail begins to descend steeply to the wetlands.  From that point, I then retraced my route back to my car parked at the intersection of Tars Pond and Hiatt Roads.--I've provided these two separate checklists to provide more detail about locations, and to distinguish between birds found in the very different habitats on the two routes along the contiguous stretches of trail and road.","Bird flushed from small game trail 2-3 m south of FR 359a"
