Drove to this spot on Elm Road which is reliable for this species and I make a point of checking it at dusk.  A few days ago I got nothing.  Tonight I pulled in from the beach road and hadn't even come to a stop when a bird flew over the car from the adjacent scrub.  There was still decent light.  I pulled over and leaned out of the car and could hear several birds peenting.  One close and one further off.   The closer was peenting but didn't fly up and do his twittering.  The further one did and passed over my car.   Then, the stubborn one finally took flight and nearly landed on the hood of my car.  Came down in the road next to me and waddled over to the side of the road.  Peents that close are loud!  Too dark for a photo and, as soon as I found and turned on my sound app, he went quite and finally flew off.","523–599 Elm Rd, Falmouth, MA, US",41.53926649,-70.63446734,10,Barnstable,Massachusetts
