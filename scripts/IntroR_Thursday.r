#### Getting files from someone else ####

# Open and read through the files in the (Population Ecology) folder.     
# Look back at Day 1 code if you need a refresher
# Tip: switch to YOUR filepath, view using view(filename) or head(filename)

# Look at the variables/columns in the files ending with .csv. Your advisor 
# sends you a script (hunting.R) she used to analyze
# a different with. 
# It is your job to decide what in that script works/wouldn't be useful 

# Remember this script is from your advisor, YOU don't need to use everything 
# in it. You need to decide which parts can/can't/don't need to be used.

#### Answer the following questions about hunting.R to better understand 
# the data and code ####


#### Run up to line 109, then answer the questions
#
# 1) What does your advisor (generally) do to the data before line 93? (3 things)
#    a)
#    b)
#    c)
#     
# 2) What happened to the variable "df" between lines 93-108?
#
#
# 3) what are the column names in 25_rows.csv? (7 total) & Where do these column
#    values come from?
#  
#
#### Run the rest of the lines (after 109)
# 4) Does the linear model fit the data?
#
#
# 5) What are some functions that don't work for the data? How do you know?
#     
#
# 6) What trends do you see in the graphs? Are these trends significant or not?
#
#
# 7) *Opinion Q* What do you like about hunting.R's format? How would YOU format
#    this file? What do you still want to know about this data?
#
